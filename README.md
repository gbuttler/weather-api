# Weather API

### Aims

- Create a weather app that fetches the weather for a specified place and time, using an HTML form.
- Adjust the background colour based on the temperature.
- Grow my confidence in using APIs.

### Future Steps

- add more useful information
- have a suggestion within the 'place' box to help with spelling
- create a better colour selection (these are a little too murky for me)

_Inspired by the Odin Project_
